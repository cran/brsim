# brsim 0.3:

* Parameter 'number.cex' added to control the size of the labels used to display the coefficients in the rendered heatmap;
* Fix to an error produced when the 'clust' parameter was set to 'FALSE';
* Fix to the number of colors passed to 'col.lim' parameter of the the underlying 'corrplot()' function; earlier settings were producing a warning message and were negatively affecting the colour scale employed in the rendered heatmap;
* Minor internal optimisations;
* Fixes and improvements to the help documentation.
